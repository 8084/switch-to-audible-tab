# Switch to audible tab

[Install from AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/switch-to-audible-tab/) / [source code](https://gitlab.com/klntsky/switch-to-audible-tab)

This addons allows the user to switch to the tab that is currently making sound.

If there are multiple audible tabs, the addon will cycle through them. If there are none, the addon will do nothing. Tabs that are muted by the user are also considered audible.

Alt+Shift+A is a hotkey that can be used instead of clicking the icon.
